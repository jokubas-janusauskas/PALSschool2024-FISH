#### Before we proceed, I recommend you make a folder dedicated to today's workshop and download all the files in this repository to it.
##
## Install MiniConda
#### We'll be running some Python scripts. For that we'll need Conda installed. Follow the instructions here to install it from command line on your OS:
#### https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install
##
## Set up the Conda environment
#### Once Conda is installed, we'll need to set up the environment. Download the fish_training.yml file, put it in a folder dedicated to today's workshop and execute the following command:
#### conda env create --name fish_training --file fish_training.yml
#### This may take a few minutes
##
## Activate the environment
